#### [The PR Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) 
All code changes happen through Pull Requests.
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints. ```npm run standard```
6. Issue that pull request!

#### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
1. Using welcoming and inclusive language
2. Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
3. Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
4. Focusing on what is best for the community
5. Showing empathy towards other community members
